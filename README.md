Question Answering on SQuAD2.0 - Comparative Analysis of Transformer Models for Machine Reading Comprehension

## Problem Description
Develop a Question Answering model that can comprehend and process natural language questions, extracting pertinent information from a given text to provide accurate answers. The model should effectively retrieve knowledge and enable information extraction from textual data. It must also have the capability to refrain from providing an answer when no relevant information is found in the text.

## Data
Stanford Question Answering Dataset â€“ [Link](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)

SQuAD 2.0 is a benchmarking dataset for machine reading comprehension and question answering. It consists of over 100,000 question-answer pairs based on diverse passages. Also, SQuAD 2.0 introduces unanswerable questions in addition to answerable ones, challenging models to identify when a question has no answer in the provided passage.
